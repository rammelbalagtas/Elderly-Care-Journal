# Elderly Care Journal
Eldery Care Journal is an iOS mobile app where the guardian of an elderly person can create an itemized list of care instructions that they want their family member to receive from the care provider. Currently, this discussion normally happens offline or verbally between the guardian and the care provider. I believe that having this mobile application will provide significant improvement in how these care services are delivered. It will ensure that proper and complete care is provided which could give peace of mind to the guardian (i.e., the client) that everything is taken care of while they are away or busy with work.
